# World of blocks

_Imagine a colored world of blocks that consists of black and white blocks that can be moved by the robotic arm. Blocks can be stacked on one another, uncoated, raised and lowered, as in the classical world of blocks. In addition, they can be colored, more precisely, the under (lower) block can get the color of the upper (higher) block, if stacked one on the other._

The code implements the problem using STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) description language. 

## Structure

Repository is organized as following:
- `doc` directory contains assignment as well as solution document(s)
- `source` directory contains code
